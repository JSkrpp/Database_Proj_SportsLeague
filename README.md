# Database Project - Small Sports League Management App  

This app is a project for databases class at Wroc≈Çaw University Of Science and Technology.  
It allows the user to realize basic CRUD operations on a MS SQL Database.  

## Overwiev  
  -The app is written solely in C# langueage  
  -For now it uses a local server so it cannot be used reliably on different machines  
  -I used this project as a way to learn WindowsForms and I used them to create the user interface  
  -As of 05.01.2025 it uses queries made as strings, so it is susceptible to SQL injection, but as databese safety was not a requirement for the project, I simply did not focus on it.
